Mixer for Spindrone Airframe
==================================================

This file defines mixers suitable for controlling a Quadrocopter + based craft
with two motors L,R for yaw control.

I am using the left knob for Vertical Throttle, CH10 (MC Throttle), mapped with QGC

Specify that we're running a + config
R: 4+ 10000 10000 10000 0
